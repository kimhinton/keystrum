## Demo

<div align="center">

<img src="public/demo.gif" alt="keystrum demo — strumming six guitar chords on a QWERTY keyboard" width="720" />

<sub>Strumming Am → C → Em → G → Dm → F, then a quick Am–F–C–G progression. All sound generated live in the browser via Karplus-Strong synthesis — no samples, no downloads.</sub>

</div>

## Quick Start

[**Try it live**](https://keystrum.app) — no install. Or run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kimhinton/keystrum.git
cd keystrum
pnpm install
pnpm run dev    # → http://localhost:3000
```

Requires **pnpm ≥ 10** and **Node ≥ 22**. Press a column of keys (e.g. `2 W S X`) → hear a C major chord.

## What is this?

keystrum lets you practice guitar chords without a guitar. It's not a guitar simulator, not a toy piano — it's a dedicated strum machine built for the QWERTY keyboard you already have.

Your keyboard has four usable rows. Each row becomes a string. Each vertical column maps to a chord. Sweep a column top-to-bottom fast — that's a strum. The sound is generated live via Karplus-Strong physical-modeling synthesis, the same algorithm used for real plucked-string sounds. No samples, no downloads.

```
         Am       C       Em       G       Dm       F
       ┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
  E4   │  1   │  2   │  3   │  4   │  5   │  6   │  ← highest pitch
       ├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
  B3   │  Q   │  W   │  E   │  R   │  T   │  Y   │
       ├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
  G3   │  A   │  S   │  D   │  F   │  G   │  H   │
       ├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
  D3   │  Z   │  X   │  C   │  V   │  B   │  N   │  ← lowest pitch
       └──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘
                                              Mute keys: J  K  L  ;
```

Hit `2` → `W` → `S` → `X` fast. You just strummed a **C major** chord.

## Why keystrum?

**Music beginners learning chords.** You hear "just practice your chord changes" and you don't own a guitar yet — or you do, but you're on the subway or in a hotel. keystrum gives you the six most common chords in C major / A minor on the keyboard in front of you. The muscle memory translates back to a real guitar: same chord progressions, same strum timing, same mute feel.

**DAW producers sketching ideas.** You're in Logic or Ableton, you want to hear an Am–F–C–G progression before you commit to a MIDI pattern. Open a tab, hit `1` `q` `a` `z` → you hear Am. No plugin loading, no sample library scanning. Karplus-Strong produces an acoustic-guitar tone live in Web Audio.

**Late-night jammers without a guitar at hand.** Your guitar is in the other room, the amp is off, the roommate is asleep. keystrum is a full-volume practice rig through headphones with real chord voicings and real strum detection. Sweep the column fast — it strums. Sweep slow — it picks.

**Music teachers looking for a browser chord tool.** Classroom Chromebooks don't have guitars, but every Chromebook has a keyboard. keystrum opens in any browser with no install, no login, no data stored on servers. Point a student's URL at `keystrum.app/play` and they have a chord trainer with three folk songs and progressive difficulty.

keystrum is not a replacement for a real instrument. It targets one specific gap: muscle-memory practice for diatonic chord changes when no guitar is at hand.

## Practice Mode

Three songs with progressive difficulty:

| Song | BPM | Time Sig | Difficulty | Mute Keys | Description |
|------|:---:|:--------:|:----------:|:---------:|-------------|
| House of the Rising Sun | 72 | 4/4 | Easy | J | Am–C–Dm–F progression, single strums to pairs |
| Scarborough Fair | 92 | 3/4 | Medium | J, K | Dorian waltz, introduces second mute key |
| Greensleeves | 100 | 3/4 | Medium | J, K, L | Full 6-chord usage, three mute keys |

Each song has two verses: **Verse 1** teaches the pattern sparse. **Verse 2** plays it full.
